First release on github 
Sunday - 23/06/2024

- I still encounter some bugs on the website or some changes I need to make. (4 cards of my experience)
- The cards on my project, those need to go onto the left side line aswell.
- spelling mistakes that I need to fix.
- All the elements on a phone screen needs to be fixed asswell, mostly padding... 

--------------------------

PATCH #1 - 24/06/2024

- In this patch of my website I've checked and improved the spelling.
- The website on the phone is now fixed and should be working.

- I reconsidered the cards on "my projects" they are better when they are centered, like now.
